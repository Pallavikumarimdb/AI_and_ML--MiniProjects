# Write a program to implement the na√Øve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored as a .CSV file.
# Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data sets

# importing the libraries

import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
# importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv("NaiveBayes.csv")

# split the data into inputs and outputs
X = dataset.iloc[:, [0,1]].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, 2].values
# training and testing data
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# assign test data size 25%

# scalling the input data

# importing classifier
